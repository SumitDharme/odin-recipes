    <ol>
        <li>Boil a pot of water (typically 2 cups per serving) and add the Yippee Noodles
            once the water is boiling. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions, 
            usually for about 2-3 minutes or until they become tender but not mushy.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, you can optionally heat a small amount of cooking oil in a separate pan
            and stir-fry your choice of vegetables or protein until they're cooked to your liking.
            Set them aside.
        </li>
        <li>Once the noodles are cooked, drain them using a strainer or by simply pouring out the water.
             You can rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process and remove excess starch if desired.

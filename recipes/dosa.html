    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of urad dal (black gram lentils)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>salt of taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) separately in water until the water runs clear.
            Then, soak them in water separately for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds. Place them in a blender or food processor.
            Add a little water (about 1/4 cup at a time) and blend until you get a smooth, thick batter.
            The batter should be slightly coarse and not too runny.</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl and add salt to taste. Mix well. The batter should be of pouring consistency but thicker than pancake batter.
            Allow it to ferment in a warm place for 6-8 hours or overnight, until it doubles in volume and becomes slightly bubbly.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Grease it lightly with oil.
            Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the skillet, then quickly spread it outward in a circular motion to form a thin, even crepe.</li>
        <li>Cook the dosa until it becomes golden brown and crispy on the bottom side. 
            You can optionally add a little oil or ghee around the edges. Fold the dosa in half and serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar..</li>
    </ol>
